# MyCppJourney_Exercises_and_Projects
A personal repository of C++ exercises and projects, dedicated to **___`Dr.Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud`___**
`DBA, MBA, PMOC, PgMP®, PMP®, PMI-RMP®, CM, ITILF, MCPD, MCSD `
for their exceptional teaching.



## Description : 
This repository contains my personal C++ projects and exercises, focused on
 problem-solving, algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
 ### Repository Contents: 
 It includes solutions to practice problems, categorized libraries, and real-world projects built using these libraries : 
 1. algorithms_and_problem_solving/: contains problem-solving exercises with a focus on algorithmic thinking and structured problem breakdowns.
This folder contains a collection of carefully graded stages as follows:
* `Level 1`: Basic problems focusing on foundational C++ concepts.
* `Level 2`: Intermediate challenges that build on prior knowledge, involving arrays,random numbers, etc.
* `Level 3`: Advanced string handling and file manipulation, including vectors.
* `Level 4`: More complex problems involving dates.
* `Level 5`: Data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues using pointers.
2. **`oop_libraries/`**: C++ libraries I developed to handle common tasks, such as input/output, string manipulation, date handling, and more.
3. **`MyCppProjects/**`: A collection of C++ projects that utilize the OOP libraries I built,showcasing real-world applications.
##  Mentorship by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud : 
### Mentorship by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud : 
Throughout this journey, I have been fortunate to study under the guidance of Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud, a distinguished programming and project management expert with more than 28 years of experience. Dr. Abu-Hadhoud’s unique approach to teaching focuses on practical, real-world applications rather than just theoretical knowledge. His mentorship has shaped my understanding of programming, emphasizing clean, structured, and modular code, akin to assembling pieces of a complex puzzle or 'LEGO,' where each part seamlessly integrates into a cohesive solution.
### Dr. Abu-Hadhoud’s Platform : 
"Dr. Abu-Hadhoud also runs an educational platform, [`Programming Advices`](https://programmingadvices.com/) where he shares his insights into software development and programming best practices. His platform has been instrumental in honing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of advanced C++ concepts."
## Teaching Method Impact : 
### Teaching Methodology and Structured Thinking : 
One of the most significant aspects of **`Dr. Abu-Hadhoud`**’s methodology is his focus on structured problem-solving. Each problem is broken down into smaller components, making it easier to tackle complex challenges. This method not only helped me solve individual problems but also allowed me to develop comprehensive solutions by reusing and adapting previously learned concepts.
## Contributors : 
### Special Thanks : 
A special thanks to **`Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud`** for his continuous support and mentorship, which has been a cornerstone in my journey to becoming a proficient programmer.
## How to Use : 
Clone this repository and navigate through the folders to explore C++ exercises, solutions, and projects. The libraries can be integrated into your own projects by including the relevant files.
## Future Improvements : 
"I plan to expand the libraries with additional functionality, refine the project structures, and add more complex algorithms as I continue to grow in my C++ expertise."
