## Ex : 5/1 :
### Hire a driver (case 2) :

write a program to ask the user to enter his /her : 
- Age
- Driver license
- Has recommendation !

then print `hired` if his/age is grater than 21 and  
he/she has a driver license, otherwise print `rejected`
*or hire him /her without conditions!* if he /she has `recommendation` .
